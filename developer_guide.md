Key Implementation Details
Task Storage:
Tasks are managed in a JavaScript array, each with text, completed, and translation properties.

Translation:
The getTranslation function asynchronously fetches translations from the MyMemory API for each task.

UI Updates:
The renderTasks function updates the DOM to reflect current tasks and their translation states.

Deployment:
Deployed as a static site on Vercel. Any changes pushed to GitHub are automatically deployed.
